# MosaicBase
MosaicBase[http://49.4.21.8:8000] is a comprehensive knowledgebase for postzygotic mosaic variants from noncancer disease-related and healthy human individuals

1. Introduction

Postzygotic mosaic mutations refer to DNA changes arising after the formation of the fertilized egg, therefore only a fraction of somatic and/or germ cells in the human body would carry the mutation. If a mosaic mutation affects germ cells, it will have a chance to be transmitted to the offspring. MosaicBase is a database of mosaic mutations in non-cancer diseases and asymptomatic individuals. Through manual reviews of massive amounts of literature published in the past decades, we collect reliable mosaic mutations that are detected in non-cancer individuals and validated by multiple experimental methods. Mutations are classified according to its genomic position and mutation type. Detailed information about individuals and publications are also integrated into the database. This database aims to provide comprehensive information to researchers and physicians for a better understanding of the distribution and transmission of mosaic mutations in non-cancer genomes and facilitating genetic counseling.
